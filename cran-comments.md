## Resubmission
Thank you for your feedback, this is a resubmission. Changes made:

* Quoted package and API names in description and in other documentation, e.g. 'rayshader'

* Removed all \donttest and most \dontrun examples and replaced with smaller, <5 sec versions

* mapbox_dem() example is still wrapped in \dontrun because mapbox requires an API key

## Test environments
* local Windows 10, R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, R 3.5.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
0 errors v | 0 warnings v | 0 notes v
