## Resubmission
Thank you for your feedback, this is a resubmission. Changes made:

* Quoted 'rayshader' and 'ggplot2' in description and in other documentation

* Removed most \donttest and \dontrun examples and replaced with smaller, <5 sec versions

* mapbox_dem() example is still wrapped in \dontrun because mapbox requires an API key

## Test environments
* local Windows 10, R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, R 3.5.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
